        <span>HTML is the most basic component of the Web. Define the meaning and structure of the web content. Besides HTML, other technologies are generally used to describe the appearance / presentation <br/>of a web page (CSS) or the functionality / behavior (JavaScript).<br/>An HTML element is distinguished from other text in a document by "tags", which consist of the element name surrounded by "<" and ">". The name of an element within a tag is not case-sensitive.<br/> That is, it can be written in uppercase, lowercase, or a mix. For example, the "<"title">" tag can be written as "<"Title">", "<"TITLE">, or some other way.</span>

        <blockquote>Last year I studied a little bit of HTML, more or less I remeber most of the functions of this code. That year we had to do diferents types of websites, including the use of CSS a a little bit of Java Script. For me, HTML is a simple language, worse at the same time complex, and very versatile, with which we can create the pages we want, being limited by our imagination. </blockquote>
